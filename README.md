# promise
A Promise implementation spec-complaint optimised for readability.

* Follow the implementation commit per commit on the branch [promifill-step-by-step](https://github.com/brunoscopelliti/promise/commits/promifill-step-by-step)
starting from the commit [4e4ab3f](https://github.com/brunoscopelliti/promise/commit/4e4ab3f65c25d5d05884919948eaed9326c8642e).

* Read the blog post [Let's build a promise polyfill](https://brunoscopelliti.com/lets-write-a-promise-polyfill/).

* Watch me live coding the polyfill on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_p-PVNqhZE&list=PLZYZ2RjeQoPiJcbCzArwMQXr3gr8tXCLC).
